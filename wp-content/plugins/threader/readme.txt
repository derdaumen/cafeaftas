Threader is a very simple guestbook/forum/bulletin board system.

== Description ==

Threader utilizes the regular WordPress comments to create a very simple guestbook, or a more elaborate (but still very simple) forum.
It is very easy to get Threader up and running, and equally easy to get rid of it.
Since it uses the standard WordPress tables, all administration is handled like you normally handle comments.
Languages: English and Swedish.

== Installation ==

1. Place the package (all files in the Threader folder) in the plugins subdirectory (usually /wp-content/plugins/).
1. Choose Plugins on the Admin menu, find the Threader plugin, and Activate it.
1. For the simplest possible guestbook, create a page with this in the body: [threader], and put it on the menu somewhere.
1. For a more complete manual, see http://birchware.se/wordpress/threader/.
